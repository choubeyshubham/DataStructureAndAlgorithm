    Big O Notations is the language and metric we use
    to describe the efficiency of algorithms


    Best Case
    Average Case
    Worst Case


    O(1) Constant
    O(N) Linear
    O(LogN) Logarithmic
    O(N2) Quadratic
    O(N3) cube time complexity


    Different terms of input
    eg add and multiply in for loop
    it will be O(a+b) not O(n)
